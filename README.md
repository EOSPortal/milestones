# Milestones

## Do not tag your own issues as MVP or Post-MVP, only as Back-end/Front-end. We will go over them as a group and tag them together.

All global tickets for the MVP and final product will live here.

## What types of tickets?

Every ticket should be a singular functionality. All functionalities are welcome, and we will divide them into milestone markers.

-------

**Good Ticket:** `Allow users to filter BPs.`

**Bad Ticket:** `Allows users to filter BPs by location.`

*Keep the tickets broad, and fill out the sub-functionalities or parameters within the ticket itself.*
